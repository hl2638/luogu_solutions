I'm starting to restart (yeah I mean it) coding for solving algorithmic problems.

I have been doing it since high school but I wasn't good at it; recent years I've done little and discontinuously.
I don't know how long this will last, but by the name I'm writing this I've done 4 problems on Luogu. The first is [1004](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1004) which I've done last summer on LeetCode.
The second through fourth are part of the searching challenge ([1378](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1378), [1514](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1514), [1312](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1312)) and I couldn't solve them completely without looking at other people's solutions.

Let's see how things go the next time I'm editting this readme file.
